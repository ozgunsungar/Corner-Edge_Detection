# Corner-Edge_Detection

In this project I coded **canny edge and corner detection from scratch for python**

These codes based on [image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozgunsungar/Corner-Edge_Detection/main/image.png). So you have to adjust threshold and other numbers for your problem.

Let's have a look our base image.

# Corner-Edge_Detection

In this project I coded **canny edge and corner detection from scratch for python**

These codes based on [image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozgunsungar/Corner-Edge_Detection/main/image.png). So you have to adjust threshold and other numbers for your problem.

# Let's have a look our code. :muscle:	

Code file contains : 
-Generic Sobel
-Manual Convolution
-Magnitude of gradiants of image
-Orients of image
-Canny edge from scratch
-Corner detection from scratch

## As I mentioned before this is a our base image which is _pure_ one
